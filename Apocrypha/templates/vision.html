    <h2>Core Purpose & Philosophy</h2>
    <p><strong>Mission:</strong> To empower distributed communities—especially semi-skilled workers in underdeveloped regions—to collaboratively build startups that generate wealth and autonomy, while embedding decentralized ethics, equity, and empathy into the foundation of startup culture. Apocrypha is not about charity—it's about building a fair, profitable, and sustainable business ecosystem where ethics and success go hand in hand.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Morality through empathy, not dogma.</li>
        <li>Power should rotate, not accumulate.</li>
        <li>Community wins over individual profit.</li>
        <li>No cults of personality: systems over saviors.</li>
        <li>Open to investment, but never for sale.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Being ethical and being profitable are not opposites. We let startups operate as they will, with only a few simple beliefs: help others, especially your fellow startups; invest in each other and share equity; avoid underhanded tricks; and focus on long-term relationships over short-term profits. Being good doesn't mean being poor or taken advantage of. Be fair, don't be extremely greedy, and think of the decades ahead, not just the next quarter.</p>
    <p>Even if you had the idea or were a core contributor, you are a guiding elder, not the permanent leader or steward. You may make key calls early on and be rewarded, but there will come a time when someone with more experience or market fit will take the startup to the next level. If a startup leaves our moral code, that's okay—contributors still retain their equity, but those who leave may find that a lonely, profit-only path is ultimately unfulfilling. We don't hold grudges, but we do learn from data.</p>
    <p><strong>Community advantage:</strong> When many people come from a community, far more are directly or indirectly involved in a company's success. We have unlimited beta testers, market surveys, and a built-in audience for every launch. This means better products, faster feedback, and a proven customer base—exactly what VCs want to see.</p>
    <p><strong>Startup impact figures:</strong> A single successful tech/AI startup can create value for hundreds or thousands of contributors, employees, and users. With our model, the benefits are distributed more widely, and the odds of success are higher thanks to our community-driven approach.</p>

    <h2>System Structure</h2>
    <p>Apocrypha is not a company, but a global, decentralized, ethics-driven startup generation ecosystem. Investors back individual startups, not Apocrypha itself. The ecosystem facilitates low-ticket pooled investments, generating market traction without requiring VCs. Optional NGOs act as custodians, not owners.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Agentic Startup Flow (ASF)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Idea Intake:</strong> Semantic search, market research, and idea submission.</li>
        <li><strong>Contributor Marketplace:</strong> Roles for ideators, coders, marketers, designers, etc. ASF suggests needed roles and equity slices, confirmed by peer review.</li>
        <li><strong>Equity Distribution:</strong> Merit-weighted agent models suggest splits, with approval by ethics board or team. Finalized equity is immutable unless fraud is proven.</li>
        <li><strong>Coordination Core:</strong> Task breakdown, assignment, and project health tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Product Lifecycle:</strong> Idea → MVP → Beta → Pitch → Handoff for scaling.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Equity & Governance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Earn equity by contributing. ASF only suggests, never enforces.</li>
        <li>Ethics board has veto power, but cannot create proposals.</li>
        <li>Power rotates: 9 board members + 1 random citizen, rotated every 6 months.</li>
        <li>Karma system and public voice forum drive governance and eligibility.</li>
        <li>Even core contributors are guiding elders, not permanent leaders. Leadership rotates as the startup grows and new skills are needed.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Morality & Meme Culture</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Gamified empathy and ethical action through karma and the evolving "Apocrypha-The Divinity" NFT.</li>
        <li>Daily votes shape the symbolic figure, building a shared mythos without hierarchy.</li>
        <li>Emotional anchoring over logical preaching. Inspire through empathy, fairness, and responsibility.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Legal Framework</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No centralized IP holder. ASF is fully open-source.</li>
        <li>Governance by voluntary NGOs or cooperatives. Investments go directly to startups.</li>
        <li>Public disclaimers: "This is not a fund. We guide micro-investment only."</li>
        <li>Equity contracts handled directly by startups and contributors/investors.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Closing</h2>
    <p>This is not a startup. It is an ecosystem of principled, distributed startups. It is not a cult. It is a framework for cooperative, ethical business creation. It is not about one founder. It is about a structure that survives every founder. We will not dominate markets. We will flood them with equity, support, and innovation. And when the time comes, we will vanish—leaving only freedom behind.</p>

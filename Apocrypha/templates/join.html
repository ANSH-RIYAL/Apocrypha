    <h2>How do you want to contribute?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/join/coders">For Coders & Builders</a> – Help build the Agentic Startup Factory (ASF), contribute to open-source tools, and shape the future of decentralized startups. Earn equity and karma for your work. We value technical skill, but also fairness and a willingness to help others succeed.</li>
        <li><a href="/join/contributors">For Labor Contributors</a> – Designers, marketers, PMs, and more: find tasks that match your skills and interests. Every contribution is recognized and rewarded through our transparent equity and karma system. We believe in long-term relationships, not short-term profits.</li>
        <li><a href="/join/ideas">For Idea Contributors</a> – Share your startup ideas, get feedback, and see them come to life with the help of the ASF and a global community. Your ideas can spark new ventures and earn you a stake in their success. Even if you are a core contributor, you are a guiding elder, not a permanent leader.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Apocrypha is open to all—whether you code, create, organize, or dream. Join us to build, learn, and grow in a system where ethical business creation and profitability are not opposites. We help each other, invest in each other, and build a better future together.</p>
